# Quarto Content

- Link to source `.qmd` files, not rendered `.html` files.
- Always leave a blank line before a markdown bullet list, and use a bullet
  list (not comma-separated prose) for three or more items.
- Prefer Quarto div wrappers for new figures and tables.
- Use `#| code-fold: true` on a chunk when the *output* (plot, table) is the
  point and the code is incidental; do not fold tutorial code, short examples,
  or chunks where the console output is the main content.
- Prefer chunk options as YAML-style `#|` directives, not inline
  `r, opt = val` arguments.
- For a changed `.qmd` with R code, run
  `Rscript -e 'lintr::lint("path/to/file.qmd")'` before finishing.
- Do not hard-code computed values in narrative text. Compute them in a chunk
  and reference them with inline R.
- Treat files under `_extensions/` as vendored third-party code: read them for
  context if needed, but do not reformat or edit them as part of a content
  change.
