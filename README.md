UCD-SERG lab notes on working responsibly and effectively with AI coding
assistants: what they are, how to use them, and the policies lab members
follow. The notes are published as a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)
website at <https://d-morrison.github.io/wai/>.

The content was migrated out of the [UCD-SERG Lab
Manual](https://ucd-serg.github.io/lab-manual/)’s “Working with AI”
chapter, which had grown large enough to deserve a dedicated site. For
the lab’s broader coding, reproducibility, and collaboration
conventions, see the lab manual itself.

> **Technology in rapid evolution.** As of early 2026, AI
> coding-assistant technology is changing extremely rapidly, and we are
> still figuring out how to use these tools well. Treat everything here
> as provisional — best practices and capabilities keep moving.

## Contents

The site is organized into three main chapters:

- **[Policies for Using AI](chapters/ai-use-policies.qmd)** —
  responsibility for validation, disclosure, attribution, and using AI
  for journal articles
- **[Coding Agents](chapters/coding-agents.qmd)** — what language
  models, coding agents, and harnesses are; how to work with them; their
  benefits and hazards; and how to configure your environment
- **[Pull-Request Workflow with
  Agents](chapters/pr-workflow-with-agents.qmd)** — filing issues,
  claiming work, and driving a pull request to a clean, mergeable state

Supporting material lives under `chapters/ai-tools/`.

## Reading the notes

The rendered site is the easiest way to read the notes:
<https://d-morrison.github.io/wai/>. Each page is also available as
RevealJS slides (`-slides.html`), a PDF handout (`-handout.pdf`), and a
Word document (`.docx`).

## Building locally

You need [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) installed. This
project uses Quarto’s
[`llms-txt`](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-llms.html) website
option, which requires **Quarto 1.9.36 or newer**.

Clone the repository and its submodule (`macros/`):

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/d-morrison/wai.git
cd wai
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Preview with live reload while editing:

``` bash
quarto preview
```

Render the complete site (output lands in `_site/`):

``` bash
quarto render
```
