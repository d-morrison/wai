This site collects the UCD-SERG lab’s notes on working responsibly and effectively with AI coding assistants: what they are, how to use them, and the policies lab members follow when using them. It was migrated out of the [UCD-SERG Lab Manual](https://ucd-serg.github.io/lab-manual/)’s “Working with AI” chapter, which had grown large enough to deserve a dedicated site. For the lab’s broader coding, reproducibility, and collaboration conventions, see the lab manual itself.

> **WARNING:**
>
> As of early 2026, AI coding assistant technology is changing extremely rapidly, and we are just beginning to figure out how to use these tools effectively ourselves. All information on this site should be taken with extra caution, as best practices and capabilities continue to evolve.

## 1 Chapters

- [**Policies for Using AI**](chapters/ai-use-policies.llms.md): responsibility for validation, disclosure, attribution, and using AI for journal articles
- [**Coding Agents**](chapters/coding-agents.llms.md): what language models, coding agents, and harnesses are; how to work with them; benefits, hazards, and best practices; and configuring your environment
- [**Pull-Request Workflow with Agents**](chapters/pr-workflow-with-agents.llms.md): filing issues, claiming work, and driving a pull request to a clean, mergeable state

The notes are available in multiple formats:

- **HTML Website**: Navigate using the navbar for easy access to all pages
- **RevealJS Slides**: Each chapter can generate a presentation format with `-slides.html` suffix
- **PDF Handouts**: Each chapter can generate a PDF handout with `-handout.pdf` suffix
- **DOCX Documents**: Each chapter can generate a Microsoft Word document with `.docx` extension
